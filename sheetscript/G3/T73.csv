type of system (all),Definition. comments,pasture/ liquid / solide manure
Pasture. range. paddock,The manure from pasture and range grazing animals is allowed to lie as deposited. and is not managed.,pasture
Daily spread,Manure is routinely removed from a confinement facility and is applied to cropland or pasture within 24 hours of excretion.,liquid
Solid storage,The storage of manure. typically for a period of several months. in unconfined piles or stacks. Manure is able to be stacked due to the presence of a sufficient amount of bedding material or loss of moisture by evaporation.,solid
Dry lot,A paved or unpaved open confinement area without any significant vegetative cover where accumulating manure may be removed periodically.,liquid
Liquid / Slurry with natural crust cover,Manure is stored as excreted or with some minimal addition of water in either tanks or earthen ponds outside the animal housing. usually for periods less than one year.,liquid
Liquid / slurry without natural crust cover,Idem without natural crust cover,liquid
Uncovered anaerobic lagoon ,A type of liquid storage system designed and operated to combine waste stabilization and storage. Lagoon supernatant is usually used to remove manure from the associated confinement facilities to the lagoon. Anaerobic lagoons are designed with varying lengths of storage (up to a year or greater). depending on the climate region. the volatile solids loading rate. and other operational factors. The water from the lagoon may be recycled as flush water or used to irrigate and fertilise fields.,liquid
Pit storage below animal confinements. <1 month,Collection and storage of manure usually with little or no added water typically below a slatted floor in an enclosed animal confinement facility. usually for periods less than one year.,liquid
Pit storage below animal confinements. > 1 month,Idem with more than 1 month,liquid
Anaerobic digester ,Animal excreta with or without straw are collected and anaerobically digested in a large containment vessel or covered lagoon. Digesters are designed and operated for waste stabilization by the microbial reduction of complex organic compounds to CO2 and CH4. which is captured and flared or used as a fuel.,liquid
Cattle and swine deep bedding-no mixing. <1 month,As manure accumulates. bedding is continually added to absorb moisture over a production cycle and possibly for as long as 6 to 12 months. This manure management system also is known as a bedded pack manure management system and may be combined with a dry lot or pasture. No Mixing and less than 1 month,solid
Cattle and swine deep bedding-no mixing. >1 month,Idem excepted "No Mixing and more than 1 month",solid
Cattle and swine deep bedding-active mixing. < 1 month,Idem excepted "active Mixing and less than 1 month",solid
Cattle and swine deep bedding-active mixing. > 1 month,Idem excepted "active Mixing and more than 1 month",solid
Composting In-vessel,Composting. typically in an enclosed channel. with forced aeration and continuous mixing.,solid
Composting Static Pile,Composting in piles with forced aeration but no mixing.,solid
Composting intensive windrow,Composting in windrows with regular (at least daily) turning for mixing and aeration.,solid
Composting passive windrow,Composting in windrows with infrequent turning for mixing and aeration.,solid
Poultry manure with litter,Similar to cattle and swine deep bedding except usually not combined with a dry lot or pasture. Typically used for all poultry breeder flocks and for the production of meat type chickens (broilers) and other fowl.,solid
Poultry without litter,May be similar to open pits in enclosed animal confinement facilities or may be designed and operated to dry the manure as it accumulates. The latter is known as a high-rise manure management system and is a form of passive windrow composting when designed and operated properly.,liquid
Aerobic treatment - natural aeration systems,The biological oxidation of manure collected as a liquid with either forced or natural aeration. Natural aeration is limited to aerobic and facultative ponds and wetland systems and is due primarily to photosynthesis. Hence. these systems typically become anoxic during periods without sunlight.,liquid
Aerobic treatment -  Forced aeration systems,The biological oxidation of manure collected as a liquid with either forced or natural aeration. Natural aeration is limited to aerobic and facultative ponds and wetland systems and is due primarily to photosynthesis. Hence. these systems typically become anoxic during periods without sunlight.,liquid
Excreted on fields. sun dried dung are burned for fuel,,solid
